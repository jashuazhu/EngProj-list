          <p>
            In this demonstration, we show that a pulse with bandwidth B can still be fully recovered using only 2B samples. Even if the discrete-time samples do not coincide with the true peaks of the waveform, the information is retained, and the peak/valley locations of the signal can be accurately determined.

          <p>
            Natural disasters have long-lasting impacts on socioeconomic conditions and human well-beings. We were interested in post-disaster aid allocation in different regions after different disasters. Thus, we set the goals of the study to be examine how key socioeconomic variables — including percent unemployment, type of disaster, population size, and net population growth — influence the amount of federal aid provided following natural disasters. To support our analysis, we used heat maps, scatterplots, histograms, and bar graphs for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Overall, our project reveals that socioeconomic factors like unemployment rate, population by county, as well as net population growth by county have small predictive power in determining the amount of federal aid provided after natural disasters
